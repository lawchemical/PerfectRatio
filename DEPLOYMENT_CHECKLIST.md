# üöÄ PerfectRatio Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps
- [x] Created Railway backend with caching
- [x] Updated iOS app to support Railway + Supabase fallback
- [x] Initialized Git repository
- [x] Generated secure API key: `pr_live_7bbfqrKTfUZVnw00_kvsS9_UPRwiyKhoJ2xh9xLYoqM`
- [x] iOS app builds successfully

## üìã Your Action Items

### 1. Push to GitHub (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/seanlaw/Documents/PerfectRatio/railway-backend
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/perfectratio-backend.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway (10 minutes)
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select `perfectratio-backend`
4. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
5. Go to Settings ‚Üí Generate Domain
6. Copy your URL (like `perfectratio-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

### 3. Configure Railway Environment (2 minutes)
In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab ‚Üí RAW Editor:
```env
API_KEY=pr_live_7bbfqrKTfUZVnw00_kvsS9_UPRwiyKhoJ2xh9xLYoqM
NODE_ENV=production
CACHE_TTL=86400
CACHE_CHECK_PERIOD=600
```

### 4. Update iOS App (5 minutes)
Edit `/Users/seanlaw/Documents/PerfectRatio/PerfectRatio/Formulator/RailwayBackendService.swift`:

```swift
struct BackendConfig {
    static let railwayURL = "https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app"
    static let apiKey = "pr_live_7bbfqrKTfUZVnw00_kvsS9_UPRwiyKhoJ2xh9xLYoqM"
    static let useRailwayBackend = true  // ‚Üê Change to true!
    static let enableFallback = true
}
```

### 5. Test Everything (5 minutes)

#### Test Railway:
```bash
# Should return {"status":"healthy"}
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/health

# Should return supplier data
curl -H "x-api-key: pr_live_7bbfqrKTfUZVnw00_kvsS9_UPRwiyKhoJ2xh9xLYoqM" \
     https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/suppliers
```

#### Test iOS App:
1. Build and run in Xcode
2. Check status indicator (should be green for Railway)
3. Tap "Test Connections" button
4. Should see "‚úÖ All connections working!"

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ Railway health endpoint responds
‚úÖ iOS app shows green "Railway Cache" indicator
‚úÖ Manual sync works and completes quickly
‚úÖ Test connections shows all green
‚úÖ Fallback to Supabase works if you stop Railway

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Railway not connecting?
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify environment variables are saved
- Make sure domain is generated
- Check API key matches exactly

### iOS app showing "Direct Supabase"?
- Verify `useRailwayBackend = true`
- Check Railway URL has https:// and no trailing /
- Verify API key matches
- Check Xcode console for errors

### Need to test fallback?
1. Set `useRailwayBackend = false` temporarily
2. App should work with direct Supabase
3. Set back to `true` when Railway is working

## üìä Monitor Performance

After deployment, you can check:
- Cache hit rate in iOS app debug info
- Railway logs for request patterns
- Response times (should be <100ms for cached)

## üéâ You're Done!

Once all tests pass, your app is ready to handle 10,000+ concurrent users with:
- ‚ö° Lightning-fast cached responses
- üîÑ Automatic background sync
- üíæ Real-time user data persistence
- üõ°Ô∏è Automatic fallback protection

**Total deployment time: ~25 minutes**

Remember to keep your API key secret and never commit it to Git!
